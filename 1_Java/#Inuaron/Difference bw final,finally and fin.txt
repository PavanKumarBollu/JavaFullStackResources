Difference b/w final,finally and finalize
=========================================
final
  => final is the modifier applicable for classes, methods and variables
  => If a class declared as the fianl then child class creation is not possible.
  => If a method declared as the final then overriding of that method is not possible.
  => If a variable declared as the final then reassignement is not possible.

finally
  => It is a final block associated with try-catch to maintain clean up code, which should
     be executed always irrespective of whethere exception raised or not raised and whether
     handled or not handled.

finalize
  => It is a method, always invoked by Garbage Collector just before destroying an object to
     perform cleanup activites.

Note::
  1. finally block meant for cleanup activites related to try block where as finalize() method
     for cleanup activites related to object.
  2. To maintain cleanup code finally block is recomended over finalize() method because we can't
     expect exact behaviour of GC.
