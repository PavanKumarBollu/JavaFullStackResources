Constructors
============
-constructor is a specialized method in java which is used to assign the default value to the class members or to perform some activity when you create a objects.


-when you don't create any constructor by default the compiler will keep the default constructor behind the scenes.  

-Same name as class name
-we can have the parameters
-constructor will be called automatically when you create a object
-return statement is invalid
-will not have return type explicitly
-inside constructor Frist statement is super() or this()
-super() calls the parent class constructor
-this() calls the same class constructor
-both this() and super()in same constructor is invalid
-we can't write the super() or this() other than the first line inside the constructor.



Constructor Overloading
=======================

-having more than one constructor in a same class allowed as long as they differs in the parameters.

-we can create a parameterized constructer inside a class, when you create a parameterized constructor the compiler will not keep any default constructor.


Methods Vs Constructor
=====================

Methods
-------

-call explicitly by using the method name;
-explicit return type needed except void type
-writing the return statements is allowed

Constructor
-----------
-when the object is instantiated automatically the constructor is called.
-no explicit return type is allowed.



this Vs this()
==============

this
----

-this is a keyword which contains the current object reference 
-this always refers to the current object.


this()
------

-this() is a method which we use to call the same class constructor
