EveryClass in java have two parts 
	1. Has Part
	2. Does Part




Has Part
========

	in has part we will declare the variables and assign some values to it


Does Part
=========
	does part is nothing but methods which we will use to do some activity 

Note: if you want to do some activity you must and should do that inside a method otherwise compile time error.


Example:

	-->Student info

class Student
{
	//has part
	String name	= "Rohit";
	int age		= 24;
	String rollNo 	= "CSE01";

	public void display()
	{
		System.out.println("Student Name "	+ name);
		System.out.println("Student Age " 	+ age);
		System.out.println("Student rollNo " 	+ rollNo);	
	}

	public void exam()
	{
		System.out.println("Student Writing the Exam");
	}


	public static void main(String[] arg)
	{
		display();
		exam();	
	}
}
