=> What is Framework

Framework is not a new technology, rather it is an abstraction provided on top of technology.

=> Spring Overview
=>Building Applications Using Technology
=> Building Applications Using Framework
=>Building Applications Using Application Framework.
=> Distributed Applications
=> Local Client And remote client
=> Spring IOC

 Spring    -----> based on configuration details supplied, it will create 
an object and maintains the object and performs dependency injection.


=> Different types of Framework to build application
 =================================================
 	a. Web application based framework
 	b. ORM Framework
 	c. Application Framework
 	d. Bigdata Framework
 	e. Distributed Application Development framework


=>  Based on the mode of development we do, we have 2 types of framework
 	a. Invasive Framework
		 eg: Servlet,Struts(1.X)
 	b. Non-Invasive Framework
		 eg: Spring,Hibernate,......


=> Terminologies

	1. Middleware Services
 	2. Java Bean
 	3. LocalClient vs RemoteClient


=>  How Spring evolved?

=> Is Spring alternative to EJB, Struts, Hibernate, JEE technology?

 Spring vs EJB
 -------------

	Answer. No , Spring framework is used to develop all kinds of app. Web Services are alternative to EJB's.

 Spring Vs Struts
 ----------------

 	Answer. No, Struts will be used to build only webbased application Spring can be used to build any type of application.

    		SpringMVC is an alternative to Struts.

     Spring vs Hibernate
     ===================

 Answer. NO, hibernate is orm framework to build persistence logic Spring has its own orm module through which it promotes abstraction

   	SpringORM, SpringDataJPA is an alternative to hibernate.

    Spring vs JEE(Java Enterprise Edition)
-------------------------------------------

 Answer. No, JEE is a technology which gives api for persistence logic and building webapps  Where as Spring provides an abstraction on top of JEE api's
 		 
		SpringJDBC-> JDBC,
		SpringMVC-> Servlet, JSP


SpringCore
==========

 It is base module for other modules.
  => This module is given to supply Spring containers to perform Dependency management.
  => This module gives 2 spring containers/IOC[Inversion Of Control] containers called
 		a. BeanFactory Container
 		b. ApplicationContext Container(Latest one)
  		=> These 2 containers perform the following operations
 			a. It manages the SpringBean/Object life cycle
 			b. It performs Dependency Management
			a. Dependancy LookUp[JNDI]
 			b. Depenancy Injection[commonly used]


 SpringApp can be developed in 4 approaches
 	a. XML approach(only used in maintenance project).
 	b. using Annotation driven configuration(XML + Java).
 	c. using java code configuration.(no XML)
 	d. using Spring boot autodriven configuration.[supported by SpringBoot]
 Different modes of DependancyInjection
 =====================================
 1. Setter Injection.
 2. Constructor injection.
 3. Field injection.
 4. MethodInjection/Method replacer.
 5. LookUp Method Injection.
 6. Dependancy LookUp Injection.


=> What is SpringBean?

	Any Java class(PreDefined/userDefined/ThirdParty api) whose object is created and  managed by Spring container is called "SpringBean".
 
=> Dependancy Management
 =======================
 => It is the process of assigning dependant object to Target object by loading both the classes and by creating the objects for both the classes.
 => The classes/objects which uses the other class services is called "Target Class".
 => The classes that acts like helper class to main/target class is called "Dependant class".

 		eg:: Target class    => Flipkart, Vehicle,   
			Student,      Mobile
 			CourseMaterial,  SIM
=> 1. Setter Injection.
     Dependant class => DTDC    , Engine , 
=> It is the process of assigning dependant object to Target object by loading both the classes and by creating the objects for both the classes and injecting the Dependent object to Target Object using Setter is called "Setter Injection".

	Tell me which id will be injected as final values?

=> Bean Factory Lazy Loading 

=> Application Context Eager Loading

***** VVVV IMP *******
=> One Project using SpringCore[DI strategy by configuring the container]-----> Check the images once to get the clarity of the project

=>  Reading the data from properties file into xml
	To read the data from properties file into xml by the container we need to use "ApplicationContext(I)" IOC container.

=> Scope attribute in Spring
	singleton (default)
	prototype
	will be discussed in web application (HTTP protocol)
	=================================================
 	request
 	session
	application
 	WebSocket


***** VVVVVVIMP ******
=> Note: Can we make SpringIOC container to create only one object, even if the scope is prototype?
  ans. Yes, by writing our own design pattern code and also using an attribute called <bean  ... factory-method=""> in xml file.
	Check the code in the pdf once to get the more clarity


=>  Default bean id
 	fullypackagenameFollowedby#0 ( Starts with #0 )
	Ex: com.pavan.beans.Student#0
	

****** VVVVV IMP ***********

=> Driver Manager Source into Project and Layered Approach Style




================================
24_03_2023_SpringClass_notes.pdf 
================================


=> While developing layered application, Instead of configuring all DAO classes, ServiceClass, Controller Class as a springbean in single configuration file(.cfg.xml),It is recommended to take multiple xml files and link them to single xml file.
			<import resource="location of .xml file"/>


=> Collection Injection

	 Property type		 tag/attribute
 	===============		 =============
   	simple/primitive-------->  <value>
 	object ----------------->  <ref>
     	array  ----------------->  <array>/<list>
    	List  ------------------>  <list>
     	Set  ------------------->  <set>
    	Map  ------------------->  <map>
     	Properties ------------->  <props>


=>  Collection injection in Realtime


=> NULL Injection 
	setter injection      --> by default it is null if you won't specify any value
	constructor injection --> bean won't be created if you won't specify any value

=> Bean inheritance

	parent="parentId" and abstract = true


=> Important points of inheritance in bean configuration file

=> Bean inheritance in Realtime

=>  Assignment Project with following Specifications
		
		Design a layered approach application to perform CRUD opearation on database called  Employee using SpringCore Concepts 
		to be used are 
			a. Properties file injection
 			b. use BeanInheritane and work with hikaricp
 			c. use Collection injection
 			d. use VO,BO,DTO approach
 			a. Employee => eid, ename, eage, eaddress 
				operation performed are
 				a. insert
 				b. update(by doing validation)
 				c. delete
 				d. read based on id
 				e. getAllRecord

=> Collection Merging

	Keypoints
	--------
	=> Collection merging is possible only with collection, array bean properties...not on simple, object type bean properties
 	=> merge attribute is available only in <list>,<set>,<map>,<props>,<arry> tags
 	=> The possible values for merge attributes are
		 a. false
		 b. true
		 c. default(default)
	=> Both setter and constructor injection supports the "collection merging".

=> Bean alias

=> AutoWiring

	Assigning the dependent class object to target class object is called "Dependency injection" / "AutoWiring".

	AutoWiring can be done in 2 ways
		a. Explicit AutoWiring / Manual Injection
 			a. <property name='' ref=''/>
 			b. <constructor-arg name='' ref=''/>
 		b. AutoWiring / AutoInjection
 			<bean id ='' class='' autowire=''/>
 			autowire will take 3 values
 				a. byName
 				b. byType
 				c. constructor
 	Note: AutoWiring is very useful because it helps in RAD(Rapid Application Development).

=> autowire = byName

=> autowire = byType

=> autowire = constructor

=> limitations of AutoWiring

=> autowire-candidate = false


	 What is the difference b/w autowire and autowire-candidate.?
 		autowire = no => Disables the AutoWiring, programmer should explicitly perform AutoWiring.
 		autowire-candidate =false => it makes the spring bean not to participate in AutoWiring.

 	 Note: The bean which is disabled through <bean id="" class="" autowire candidate="false"/> can be used for Explicit AutoWiring
 

=>  Support of I18N(Internationalization) Making our application work for all different locale is called I18N.
  Locale => Language+ Country eg: en-US, en-BR, hi-IN, fr-FR, de-DE,.....

=> p-namespace and c-namespace 

=> Syntax for p-namespace and c-namespace

	<bean   p:propertyname="<value>" p:propertyname-ref="<beanid>"/>
   	<bean   c:propertyname="<value>" c:propertyname-ref="<beanid>"/>

=>  Limitations of p and c namespace

=> List of Annotations
	1. @Configuration
 	2. @Required
 	3. @Repository
 	4. @Order
 	5. @Autowired
 	6. @Qualifier
 	7. @Scope
 	8. @Component
 	9. @Service
 	10.@Controller
 	11.@Bean
 	12.@DependsOn
 	13.@Lazy
	14.@Value
 	15.@Import
 	16.@ImportResource
 	17.@ComponentScan
 	18.@PropertySource
 	19.@Primary
 	20.@LookUp
 	21.@PostConstruct
 	22.@PreDestroy

***** VVVIMP *****
=> Mode of Spring application development

	1. XML Driven
 	2. Annotation driven configuration[XML + Annotation(bean code)]--> Using Xml For Container Configuration and Annotation for other things
 	3. 100% code driven configuration (pure java/no xml) --> using only java code no xml
 	4. Spring boot driven configuration 

=> Annotation Driven Configuration
	@Required --> Deprecated not using in real time if you want to use you don't any other choice go for the constructor injection
	@Autowired 


***** VVVIMP *****
=> Stereotype Annotation --> Refer image file for the better clarity
	We have multiple annotations with similar behavior. having minor differences so they are called as "Stereotype annotations".

	@Component --> To configure java class as Spring bean (bean will be created and it is managed by IOC container)

	@Service ----> @Component + also makes the service class by giving Transaction management support(Spring AOP)
	
	@Repository--> @Component + also makes the DAO class by Exception propagation facilities(SQLException to Spring specific Exception)

	@Controller  =====> @Component + also makes the Controller class getting the facility of handling HTTP Requests. (SpringMVC)


=> Annotations used for lazy loading, keeping the beans in particular scope, and getting values from properties file.

 	@Lazy ===> On the bean it would perform Lazy Loading
 	@Scope ==> It specifies the scope in which the bean should be kept.
 	@PropertySource(value="") => It specifies the location from where the properties file data should be taken.

***** VVV IMP *****
=> For Creating the project using the Spring --> refer the image for project setup idea 

=> Spring Bean Life Cycle

=> 100%Code driven SpringApp development/Java Config Approach of SpringApp development

	Thumb Rule
	----------
	1. Configure userDefined classes as Springbean using Stereotype annotations(@Component) and 
	   link them with Configuration class alternative to Springbean cfg file(xml file) using @ComponentScan

	 	note: Java class that is annotated with @Configuration automatically becomes Configuration class

 	2. Configure PreDefined class as Spring beans using @Bean methods(method that is annotated with @Bean) of @Configuration class.
 	3. use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext class to create an IOC container having @Configuration class as the input classname
 	
	Note: @Configuration class is internally a Spring bean because @Configuration internally contains @Component.


=> Usage of @Import(In 100%purejava code configuration)
	@Import(Resource = {Persistence.Class, Service.class, Controller.class})
 	@Configuration
 	public class AppConfig{
 	
	}

=> How to load data from properties file into Springbean ?
 a. Using application.properties file ====> @PropertyResource(value="location of properties file") and binding it to @Value("${}") of field
 b. Using application.properties file ====> Environment(I) =====> Inside bean call environment.getProperty("")

	refer:: IOCProject-29-RealTimeDI-100%SpringAnnotationsCRUDAPP

=> usage of the Environment(I) --> refer the image file for the clarity
